Encryption is a method of data security that converts data from a readable format into an encoded format that can only be read or processed after it has been decrypted using a cryptographic key. Itâ€™s a common process in cryptography that encodes a message or information so that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot.

Encryption is essential to cybersecurity and data protection, as it protects private information and sensitive data and enhances the security of communication between client apps and servers. Encryption is critical to every organization because it protects confidential data by converting it into ciphertext.
